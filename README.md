Life Quotes Project
Description :
The Life Quotes Project is a simple web application that displays inspirational quotes and features a gallery of images with interactive animations. Users can click a button to get a random quote, and the images on the page are styled with CSS for a visually engaging experience.

Features :
Display a random quote on button click.
Show a gallery of images with custom styles.
Responsive design to ensure a good experience on different devices.

Files :
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the page and images.
script.js: The JavaScript file to handle quote generation and interactivity.
bg.jpg, bg1.jfif, bg2.jfif, bg3.jfif: Sample image files used in the image gallery.

Usage :
Open the Project: Open index.html in a web browser.
Get a Quote: Click the !Quote For You! button to generate and display a random quote.
View the Image Gallery: Scroll down to see the image gallery styled with CSS animations.

How It Works :
HTML: Contains the basic structure of the page, including the button and image gallery.
CSS: Provides styling for the page and animations for the images. (e.g., borders, circular motion)
JavaScript: Handles the logic for generating and displaying a random quote. (Ensure this script is added in script.js.)
